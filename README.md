arduino-tick
============

A pulse generator for the lavet-type [stepper motor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavet_type_stepping_motor) typically found in (cheap) clock movements, 
like [this](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0093YX7QI/).

This library is based on the circuit and code presented here:
http://www.cibomahto.com/2008/03/controlling-a-clock-with-an-arduino/
Which is a good reference for the kind of circuit you'll need to use this, 
and the code available there does basically the same thing; but in the Arduino IDE, using delays.
